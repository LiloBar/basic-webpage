          <h3>Dubai</h3>
          <p>Beacuse Dubai is one of the city that have the best infrastructure in the world,
           and that it is one of the emirates that form the UAE (United Arab Emirates).
              Perhaps the most famous of the seven regions,
              and just because of two words; eccentricity and luxury.

              In less than thirty years,
              Dubai changed from being a little fishing village to
              the famous awesome city that is today. </p>
