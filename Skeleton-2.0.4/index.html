          <h3>Dubai</h3>
        <p>
          Beacuse Dubai is one of the emirates that form the UAE (United Arab Emirates).
              Perhaps the most famous of the seven regions,
              and just because of two words; eccentricity and luxury.
        <br>
        <br>
              In less than thirty years,
              Dubai changed from being a little fishing village to
              the famous awesome city that is today.
